# Birthday-strap

A birthday Bootstrap theme

## Instructions

This project uses Sass to customize the color palette in Bootstrap, which is installed as a node module. Changes in development are displayed immediately using Browser-sync.

It includes an index.html file with examples of Bootstrap code using the primary, success, info, warning, and danger color classes. A sass file (main.scss) sets Bootstrap's color variables and imports Bootstrap.

To compile the sass file, run `./node_modules/.bin/sass main.scss main.css`.

To start Browser-sync, run `./node_modules/.bin/bundle-sync --server --files "main.css"`.
